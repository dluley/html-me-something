                    <p>These are my older brothers. Growing up, they may not always set
                        the best examples, and we don't always get along. But, that's okay because
                        they are one of the few people in my life who have always been there
                        for me to talk to, no matter what. Before I was born, my mom 'adopted' my brothers'
                        friend Chad and he lived with us my entire life so I always considered him my 
                        older brother, too. Although he isn't pictured here, he was a part of our family
                        so we were all greatly impacted when he passed away during my first year at middle 
                        school. At the time, I was still pretty young and was told he was in a car 
                        accident. When I was older I learned that he started spending time with a 
                        new group of friends in high school and started using heroin. He died in 
                        2007 from an overdose and my brother Chris left home, mad at the world 
                        and at my mom for not forcing him to get help. Not that she had too much 
                        spare time while raising five kids on her own and working two jobs. But
                        everything changed since then and I never understood why all of 
                        it was happening until I was old enough to know what really happened.
                        So growing up I remember feeling angry about everything changing so fast 
                        and not seeing my brothers anymore, and being angry with my parents because 
                        my brothers seemed to be and there was nothing I could do to bring 
                        anyone back together or make them get along. Now that I know what 
                        really happened, I look back on how they behaved while trying to cope with 
                        their loss and I see the paths they've taken in life as a result of those 
                        behaviors and I think today about how I could help them get closer 
                        to the paths they planned on taking as long as I make different choices 
                        than they did. They've taught me a lot without even knowing it, and I will 
                        always look up to them for not giving up all the times that they could have.
                        My brothers all mean the world to me, no matter what. When no one else 
                        is there for me, they are. Even when they don't know what to say, they've 
                        always stuck around to listen.

                    </figure>

                    <p>This is Mike. We met when I was fifteen and were together all through and 
                        for awhile after high school. Somewhere during these five years he went from 
                        being my best friend, to being my only friend. My parents saw things in him 
                        that I didn't see, and ultimately kicked me out and stopped speaking to me
                        by my sophomore year of high school. At first I stayed with friends some nights
                        and nobody knew it was because I couldn't stay at home. Eventually I started
                        staying with Mike and that's when he started getting a little more controlling,
                        defensive, and manipulative. By my senior year of high school he would get 
                        angry if I stayed with my friends or even hung out with them for too long. 
                        Any time I wasn't by his side, he was angry with me.
                            I had a job at a retirement home and soon, instead of giving me rides he told me 
                        to walk from school to work and then back to his house because he was 'going to hang 
                        out with friends like I did' only he wouldn't come home until 3 or 4 in the
                        morning. Sometimes his mom and I would get calls from local jails asking to come pick
                        him up or bail him out. 
                            One day when I walked home from work I walked in on him
                        with someone else. While she got dressed and grabbed her things to leave, I 
                        started to get some of my things together to leave and try to process any of this. 
                        That's when I realized he wasn't going to let me leave. I even begged the girl I 
                        didn't know to stay until I got out, but she left anyway. 
                            That day ended with a discolacted jaw, two black eyes, plenty of sprains and 
                        bruises from being dragged around the house by my hair, cuts on the back of 
                        my scalp which broke his bedroom window, and my friend picking me up outside
                        under the carport broken, soaking wet and without any clothes. The attack was
                        documented after I was sent to the guidance counselor the next week at school.
                        After turning off my phone and still running into him three seperate times 
                        that week, I let the counselor know I decided not to press any charges. It's safe to 
                        assume I've looked back a number of times and wished I hadn't been too afraid to
                        try harder to stand up for myself at that time. But let's look beyond the continued harassments,
                        threats, the restraining orders / banning him from multiple places of work
                        and past all the times I had to get a new phone number. This goes beyond the years
                        of physical therapy for my jaw, and seeing multiple psychiatrists to try and 
                        understand how to live with everything that comes after an abusive relationship, 
                        a violent assault, or surviving a rape. 
                            What matters more than any of these personal experiences or issues, is that unfortunately
                        my decision not to take further action back then, made it possible for him to treat someone
                        else the exact same way. The criminal law degree I later began taking classes to pursue makes 
                        me want to mention that all defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty or 
                        something along those lines, but the following articles tell why he's facing a minimum 
                        of 30 years in prison. You can decide what to think for yourself.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>This is Emily (and her beagle child, Macy). After moving around between my brothers' houses and friends for awhile
                        after the incident and before I was ready to speak to my parents again and tell them anything
                        that happened, I stayed with her and her family. Shortly after we graduated McCluer North high
                        school together, her mother's cancer put her on the hospice floor of the hospital
                        and she passed away after a month or so of us visiting her whenever we could.
                        Throughout high school and during the last few months, her family felt more like
                        family to me than my own.
                        After her mom (I called her mama bear) passed away, their house was forclosed.
                        Emily, her sister Xenia and I ended up moving to St. Charles with Emily's boyfriend 
                        and all renting out the lower level of a small house together, (this picture 
                        was taken in the yard of that house). We all worked as summer camp counselors for 
                        the James J Eagan center in Florissant for the summer and I think we all tried pretending 
                        the last year or so never happened. Some of the best memories I have to this day took place during this part of my life.
                            Eventually Emily moved to Columbia to attend Mizzou, so I went back to
                        staying with my brothers and Emily's sister moved in with their grandmother.
                        Emily and I may not speak frequently anymore but she's still one of the closest
                        friends I have. Both of us did a lot of growing up together in a short 
                        amount of time. She helped me learn how to love myself again and showed me 
                        that it's worth it to make the best of things and try remaining optimistic 
                        even in the craziest situations or the worst of times. I will always admire her
                        strength and resilience. Besides family, she's the closest friend i've ever had.

                    <p> Between the time I worked at the Civic Center and starting my next job
                        at a preschool in St. Charles, I began speaking to my parents again and 
                        trying to learn to communicate with them again the best I could while still
                        not being able to speak much about anything that happened. I agreed to go on
                        a trip with my parents and my little sister to the Smoky Mountains, I think 
                        everyone's hope was that it would help us connect better by spending time with
                        them again without having to talk about or bring up anything that happened in the past.
                        I'm still not sure if it was the abundance of fresh air I got there, the fact 
                        that I got to get away from the same old places and negative energy, or 
                        maybe it was just enough time spent alone to finally process some 
                        of what happened the last few years. But this trip helped me feel like 
                        I had a sense of peace again, and gave me hope for the first time in 
                        a very long time that things will get better eventually as long as I don't 
                        give up. This was my first trip out of the state of Missouri, ever (except
                        being across the river into Illinois before). Here's a link to the 
                        <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm">National Park
                        Service page for the Smoky Mountains</a>, I highly recommend anyone to take the 
                        time to visit this place for themselves. My vacation here changed my perspective 
                        on a lot of things in life. The short time I spent here made me realize 
                        I don't have to be stuck seeing the same people and places forever. Ever since 
                        spending a few days exploring the Smokies, I know I want to live 
                        outside of the state of Missouri for awhile as soon as I'm 
                        financially able to make that happen.

                    <p>This is my baby girl Hazel, she's a Boxer (mix) that I bought while 
                        working as a Summer Camp counselor and living in St. Charles when she 
                        was eight weeks old. She's stuck by my side ever since! Frequently 
                        going on walks and hikes with her really helped to manage my anxiety
                        and depression, along with medication from my doctors. She held me 
                        accountable for caring for her and myself when I didn't have many other 
                        responsibilities at the time and taught me a great deal about time 
                        management and to start saving a little extra money when I could for things that 
                        might go wrong, like when she tried to play around with a bee hive or 
                        the time when she chewed a hole THROUGH a wooden door in the basement 
                        of the house we were renting and I had to pay to replace it. She has been  
                        one of the few constants I've had in life for awhile now. I'm really grateful 
                        that I am lucky enough to have her by my side the past five years or so.

                    <p> I was at my cousin's wedding reception, the end of June 2014.
                        I asked my brother to drop me off to stay at a friend's house 
                        for the night since my parents had been drinking and we never get 
                        along when that happens. So I spent that night hanging out with my 
                        friend Kaite, her boyfriend from Mizzou, Zach, and her brother Connor. 
                        I probably laughed more that night than I had in years. We listened 
                        to music and watched a movie, Zach and Katie passed out on the couch and 
                        Connor and I sat up talking and joking until we fell asleep holding 
                        hands like little kids on the hardwood floor. I worked at Show Me's 
                        in Florissant back then. Connor, Katie and Zach all came to see me the next day during
                        my shift. We did the same thing when I got off work, all hanging out together.
                        Things went this way for a few weeks until eventually I started staying 
                        with them. I would get off work and we would all meet up again somewhere, 
                        going to horse races, the movies, parks, wherever-over and over for 
                        months. All I did was work, some weeks I spent over 90 hours on the clock.
                        There were some nights I slept in their parking lot after closing at 3am because 
                        I was scared I wouldn't make it back before my shift at 11am if I left. We 
                        were all about working and saving money, shoveling snow and 
                        doing odd jobs together whenever we could to keep paying rent. I even
                        went back to community college and started taking classes again. 
                        Looking back I don't know how I made time for it all. But things were
                        so good. 
                            We were all pretty close after spending so much time together. 
                        But when Zach never came home on Christmas Eve after he and Katie had been 
                        arguing, nothing was the same after that. I went home Christmas morning 
                        to see my family and Connor called me crying, they found out that Zach 
                        committed suicide in his car the night before, after going home 
                        and arguing with his dad. Everything after that call is still kind of  
                        a blur to me, it all felt so unreal. Time just kept moving and before I knew 
                        it I was dropping my classes, I had quit my job, things went downhill so fast. 
                        Somehow after a few really emotional days we pulled ourselves together enough 
                        to make it to his funeral, where it took Katie over an hour to make it inside 
                        after we learned it was open-casket. We then dealt with having his whole 
                        family blame us for what happened since he had spent most of his 
                        time with us recently.
                        After the funeral is when I started to notice things I didn't before. Katie and 
                        Connor both spent more and more time being asleep to the point where they were 
                        always either too drowsy to hold a conversation or else it was the complete 
                        opposite and they were hyper and doing everything at once but only for a short 
                        period of time. They went back and forth between being sporadically extremely 
                        emotional and completely emotionless. I thought it was just because they were much 
                        closer to Zach than I was and for a much longer period of time.
                            But when they kept taking the car I was driving while I was asleep, 
                        and then other things of mine started to disappear, I knew something else 
                        was going on. 
                        Eventually they told me they had been using heroin. I spent more than a year  
                        trying to convince them to want help, basically begging them to want to live again. 
                        Every time I thought things were getting better I would find out it was all lies again. 
                        I started feeling pretty defeated. I ended up losing everything trying to save them, 
                        and refused to believe that they didn't want to help themselves. They started 
                        stealing from places and getting in trouble, I couldn't go anywhere with them 
                        anymore. It was around this time that I learned I was pregnant. When I told them, 
                        I think they were either too messed up to understand what this meant, or just 
                        too far gone to care.
                            The day I found out I was pregnant I went from smoking over a pack of newport 100's 
                        a day - to not smoking anything at all. I started eating again like a normal person 
                        and taking prenatal vitamins. I had to change the environment I was living in 
                        to convince myself I was capable of doing everything it takes to do what's best 
                        for not only myself, but someone else now too. I went back to staying with my brothers, 
                        and eventually back in with my parents because it's the best place I know of as 
                        far as being suitable for a baby. Connor tried hard to be as supportive as he could 
                        for me emotionally as I went through all of these changes, but we both knew that 
                        there would be a point where either he would have to start making changes too, or I 
                        would have to do things on my own. As hard as it was to stop talking to Connor because 
                        of how close of friends we were, I knew that if I kept letting him contact me as messed 
                        up as he was, he wouldn't have much of a reason or motivation to change anything, 
                        especially since he and Katie are still living in the same place and Katie has no 
                        intention of not using anytime soon. By the time I was nine months pregnant 
                        I was no longer in contact with Connor or Katie, but my family was surprisingly 
                        very supportive of me up until and during the birth of my daughter, despite their 
                        first reactions of shutting me out/putting me down for not being married and for 
                        being sexually active at all, let alone pregnant. To this day Connor is still 
                        the closest friend I've ever had, besides my own family, and Emily. Even when we 
                        don't talk.

                        <p>My first best friend in the whole world. This is my little sister, Kaitlyn. 
                            She's not-so-little anymore, in her third year away at college at Drury
                            University in Springfeild, Missouri. I think the time that brought my sister 
                            and I closest together, for me at least, was the day I found out I was pregnant. 
                            She's the first person I told and the only person that knew for weeks. She 
                            didn't judge me, she stayed calm when I wasn't, and she somehow convinced me 
                            that everything was going to be okay. Even further, she was the only one after 
                            everyone else found out, that I knew would truly support me no matter which path 
                            I chose at this point in my life. If it wasn't for her, I'm not sure I would 
                            have handled anything at this time in my life, half as rationally as I managed to. 
                            I will always remember the night she stayed up all night just checking in on 
                            me because she knew I was sick and felt scared and alone. I admire her 
                            for working so hard to become everything that she is today, and I 
                            don't think I could ever explain to her how grateful I am not only 
                            for having her in my life but for being there for me that night and 
                            any other time I need someone.

                    <p>From the day I found out 
                        I was going to be a mother, I got as far away as I possibly could from any bad 
                        habit I had and any negative place I was around. Ever since September 9th, 2016 
                        when I got to meet Maddy for the first time, I feel like I'm capable of 
                        anything. I know she's watching and I want her to know that she really 
                        is capable of <b>anything</b> she puts her mind to. She deserves nothing short 
                        of the best and I want to do whatever it takes for her to know and believe that, too. 
                        Madelyn went from being in the hospital for months, not keeping down anything 
                        and diagnosed "failure to thrive", to being the healthy, happy, talking 
                        and walking big one-year-old she is today. So far our journey together has 
                        brought us both such a long way from where we started. I'm going to school 
                        to be a programmer now, and I actually really enjoy all the work we're doing and 
                        the things we've learned so far. Connor (her father) recently contacted me 
                        from a rehab in Michigan to let me know that he's over one month 
                        clean, the longest he's ever been so far. He plans to keep working on himself 
                        until he's in a place in life where he can not only meet Maddy for the first 
                        time but work to have an active role in her life someday. It's really good 
                        to know he's safe somewhere for once and doing so much better. Being able 
                        to have a conversation with him again after so much time feels unreal. But no matter how great 
                        of friends I am with someone, Madelyn is and always will be all that matters and 
                        is most important to me. She's the reason I wake up in the morning and 
                        keep trying so hard to be the best version of myself I'm capable of being. I don't 
                        know if I would have even made it this far into my life if it wasn't for 
                        her saving me. And without every single moment of impact on this page, I don't 
                        know that I would have made it to Maddy. So to sum up my journey so far, 
                        I am extremely grateful for each of the things mentioned on this page, because 
                        each of them taught me something extremely valuable, and I wouldn't have been 
                        able to use any of that knowledge to get to any of the crazy places I've 
                        been in my life, if I never had those specific experiences. I'm thankful 
                        for every moment in life I've encountered, I feel I'm the best version of 
                        myself I can be today, and I'm going to keep working hard become even better. 
                            This may be a pretty lengthy list of moments already, but I know there are
                        plenty more to come, and I guess the point of writing all of this 
                        out was to help me remember to embrace all the hard times and change, to try to stay 
                        positive during uncomfortable moments or unfavorable situations.  
                        Maybe next time I find myself wondering what else could 
                        go wrong, I'll remember the time I sat down and took the time to recall and 
                        write this page about times I've felt the same way and got through it. 
                        I can say from experience that things WILL get better 
                        as long as you give them a chance to, and if you think about it 
                        long and hard enough you can always find a reason not to give up.
